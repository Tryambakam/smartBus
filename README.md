## smartBus — Real-Time Public Transport Tracking Platform

smartBus is a modern, responsive, real-time public transport tracking platform designed to visualize live bus locations, routes, stops, and estimated arrival times (ETA).
Built with a government-grade UI, role-based access, and scalable architecture, it simulates how real-world intelligent transport systems operate today.

## Live Features Overview

 Passenger (Public) View

Live bus tracking on interactive maps (Leaflet + OpenStreetMap)

Route-based filtering of buses and stops

Real-time bus list with auto-refresh

Animated bus markers with smooth motion

ETA timeline (when backend available)

Public notices & service alerts

Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)


## Role-Based Access (UI-ready)

Passenger (Public)

Driver (Planned)

Admin (Planned)

Secure login UI (backend integration planned)


## UI & UX Highlights

Government-style premium interface

Light / Dark mode toggle

Skeleton loaders for smooth loading UX

Animated transitions (Framer Motion)

Accessible typography (Inter / system fonts)

Mobile-first responsive design

## UI / UX Design

The UI/UX design for the **smartBus** platform was created using **Figma**.  
The design focuses on a clean and intuitive layout with a clear visual hierarchy, easy navigation, and responsive behavior to ensure a smooth user experience across devices.

It includes well-structured screens, consistent UI components, and clearly defined user flows. This design serves as a visual reference for development and supports future enhancements of the platform.
